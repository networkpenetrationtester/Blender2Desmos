Ok so if u actually care, download the modules required by the python script for blender,

in the client folder, put them in blender's site-packages folder, import and hit 'run' for

the blender script (this should add a panel to your blender GUI);

import the userscript to tampermonkey or whatever

then, start the node.js server in the server folder, go to https://desmos.com/3d and u should have a rat

if you want to upload a wireframe, hit 'send wireframe to desmos'

if you want to upload a solid model, make sure to triangulate the mesh first, lmao,

then hit 'send triangulated mesh to desmos'

and whatever you send should be cached in the server folder

uhh haha math and shit you can transform the points, do whatever you want, animate them idc
